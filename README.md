This is a comprehensive Spotify Music Analytics Dashboard designed to provide insights into a library of songs, likely from a personal collection or a specific dataset. The dashboard is multi-faceted, allowing the user to explore data from various angles including artists, songs, albums, popularity, and temporal trends. It effectively uses a combination of cards, bar charts, tables, and line charts to present the data

#Detailed Analysis of Dashboard Components
The dashboard is organized into several distinct sections or report pages, as indicated by the navigation pane on the left (Songs, Home, Overview).

3.28 Avg Duration Minutes: The average length of a song.
